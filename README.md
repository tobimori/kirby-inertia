# Kirby Inertia

Create server-side-rendered SPAs with Kirby and [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/).
This plugin configures your Kirby site to output Inertia responses and integrates the server-side-renderer for Inertia.

Kirby Inertia is running in production at [Woodgreen Pet Explorer](https://ask.woodgreen.org.uk/pet-explorer).
